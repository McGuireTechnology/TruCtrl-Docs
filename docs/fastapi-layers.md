# FastAPI Application Layers

A well-structured FastAPI application is organized into several layers, each with a clear responsibility. This separation of concerns makes your codebase easier to maintain, test, and scale. Below are the typical layers you should find in a FastAPI project:

## 1. Model Layer (`models.py`)
- Defines ORM models that map to your database tables (e.g., using SQLModel or SQLAlchemy).
- Example: `User` class describing the structure and types of your data as stored in the database.

## 2. Schema Layer (`schemas.py`)
- Defines Pydantic models for data validation, serialization, and deserialization.
- Used for request and response bodies in your API endpoints.
- Keeps your API contracts separate from your database models.

## 3. Service Layer (`services.py`)
- Contains business logic and operations that act on your models.
- Implements higher-level operations, such as bulk create, update, delete, or more complex workflows.
- Sits between the API routes and the database/ORM layer, making your code more modular and testable.

## 4. CRUD Layer (`crud.py`) *(optional)*
- Contains basic Create, Read, Update, Delete functions that directly interact with the database.
- Keeps raw database access logic separate from business logic.
- In some projects, CRUD logic is merged into the service layer.

## 5. Routes Layer (`routes.py`)
- Defines the API endpoints (HTTP routes) and connects them to the service or CRUD functions.
- Handles request/response, dependency injection, and error handling.

## 6. Dependencies Layer (`dependencies.py`)
- Contains reusable dependency functions for authentication, authorization, database sessions, etc.
- Used with FastAPI’s `Depends` system to inject shared logic into routes.

### Typical Flow in a FastAPI App
- **Client Request** → **Route** → **Service/CRUD** → **Model/Database**
- **Database Result** → **Model** → **Schema** → **Route** → **Client Response**

### Example File Structure
```
users/
    models.py      # ORM models
    schemas.py     # Pydantic schemas
    services.py    # Business logic
    crud.py        # (Optional) CRUD operations
    routes.py      # API endpoints
    dependencies.py# Dependency functions
```

This structure is scalable and aligns with FastAPI best practices.
